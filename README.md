#TinyVerse Android Wearable Project
This is an application that runs on an Android handheld and sends notifications to a Wearable. The notifications are a random Bible reference and verse from the tinyverse.herokuapp.com website. On the wearable, the notification presents a reply that allows the user to give a voice response as to whether or not they want to read the commentary for the verse. If they respond yes, the app sends the commentary as another notification.

I have divided this tutorial into several parts. I will post each part as a branch so you can fork it at any stage.  
## Please note:  
This is a work in progress and not guaranteed to be functional at any particular point in time.
